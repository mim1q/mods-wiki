The original fog is replaced, so dimensions like the Promenade of the Condemned look completely     different than intended (but pretty astonishing nonetheless)</p> </li> <li> <p>Complementary Reimagined - similar to the previous one, but the bloom is slightly      too strong by default and the colors are a bit off</p> </li> <li> <p>Sildurs Enhanced Default - lightweight shaders that don't change the intended feel      of the dimensions (they keep the original fog) - unfortunately some rendering in the newest releases is broken with these shaders :(</p> </li> </ul> <p>Recommended Music</p> <p>I recommend having the amazing Original Dead Cells Soundtrack   by Yoann Laulan on in the background when exploring the mod.   It will definitely help you get immersed in the world, especially if you have played Dead Cells before!</p> <p>Dead Cells</p> <p>If you like the mod I highly recommend you check out Dead Cells by Motion Twin on Steam!
