# Mine Cells Tips and Progression Guide

## General Tips

- The Big Chains are climbable!
- A compass will guide you back to the entrance of a given dimension.
- A doorway will have a star `*` next to the dimension name if you haven't visited it in a particular area yet.
- The doors leading to Boss rooms will close behind you! Make sure to be ready for the fight.
- The Boss rooms will also give you the Disarmed Status Effect, making you unable to
  place and break blocks.
- The Cursed Sword's curse is quite deadly. Be cautious when holding it in your hand!

## Recommendations

/// info | Recommended Mods
  I recommend using these mods along with Mine Cells for the best experience:

  - [Better Combat](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat) - custom attack animations for the weapons of Mine Cells
  - [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli) - required for the Mine Cells Guidebook, containing most of the info you'll ever need about the mod.  
  - [Roughly Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) - a must have to check the crafting recipes of items!
  - [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) + [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - performance boost + shader support
  - [Lootr](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lootr-fabric) - loot in chests is generated for each player separately
  - [Gravestones](https://modrinth.com/mod/gravestones) - will make retrieving your items after death a lot easier
  - [Disable Custom Worlds Advice](https://modrinth.com/mod/dcwa) - removes the annoying pop-up every time you open a world

/// info | Recommended Shader Packs
  The best shader packs to use with Mine Cells are (in my opinion):

  - [Complementary Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-shaders-v4) - visually amazing, the bloom on emissive entities looks 
    really good and the colors are on point. The original fog is replaced, so dimensions like the Promenade of the Condemned look completely
    different than intended (but pretty astonishing nonetheless)

  - [Complementary Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) - similar to the previous one, but the bloom is slightly 
    too strong by default and the colors are a bit off

  - [Sildurs Enhanced Default](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads/) - lightweight shaders that don't change the intended feel 
    of the dimensions (they keep the original fog) - unfortunately some rendering in the newest releases is broken with these shaders :(

/// info | Recommended Music
  I recommend having the amazing [Original Dead Cells Soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/5MuOiTfGZfVbZ1rPcDX5A0?si=80gkChL0SSiO3VKUetQQxQ)
  by [Yoann Laulan](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3B8Bws0xi45LCMW42h8jys?si=3g-Os2h9TU2ixeYLVlMJ6Q) on in the background when exploring the mod.
  It will definitely help you get immersed in the world, especially if you have played Dead Cells before!

/// info | Dead Cells
  If you like the mod I highly recommend you check out [Dead Cells by Motion Twin on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/)!
  It is an amazing game made by an amazing studio, and the source material for most content of this mod! If you like fast-paced exciting combat
  that is dependent on your skill and not pure luck, then the game is definitely for you.

## Progression Guide 

The best way to progress is to use the Guidebook and try to visit every dimension mentioned in it!  
If you need some pointers anyway, here is a rough overview for the latest version:

/// details | Show progression guide
    type: tip

  1. Find a doorway to the Prisoners' Quarters in the Overworld.  
     `/locate structure minecells:overworld_portal`  

  2. Explore the Prisoners' Quarters until you find a Doorway to the Promenade of The Condemned.

  3. In the Promenade, follow the road and signs to the Vine Rune. Right-click the obelisk in the underground room you
     arrive in, defeat the Elite and collect the Rune.

  4. Now, you will have two paths to take:

    a. Go to the end of the Promenade, reach the Ramparts, progress through them and fight the Concierge boss.

    b. Return to the Prison, find a place where you can use the Vine Rune, and fight the Conjunctivius boss.
