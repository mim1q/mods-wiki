## Conjunctivius

![Conjunctivius](img/bosses/conjunctivius.jpg){: .side-image}

The Conjunctivius is a massive mutant creature that emerged from the sewers.
She has been contained and chained to the walls of her chamber in the hopes
it will keep her from wreaking havoc

/// info | Spawns in
  - [Insufferable Crypt](./dimensions.md#insufferable-crypt)

/// info | Drops
  - Diamonds, gold and emeralds
  - Cursed Sword
  - Conjunctivius' Tentacle
///

/// info | Boss fight description
  In the first phase Conjunctivius has two attacks:

  - A body slam where she will extend her spikes and charge at a player
  - A lacerating aura activated when a player gets too close to her

  Upon reaching a certain health threshold she will scream, summoning a few
  [Sewers' Tentacles](./enemies.md#sewers-tentacle). She will remain invincible 
  until all the tentacles have been killed. After the first tentacle phase the 
  Conjunctivius gains a new attack:

  - A barrage of bolts targeted at a player

  The Conjunctivius will enter the tentacle phase two more times, and after the
  last one she will gain the last attack, which is quite rare:

  - A massive barage of bolts, flying in random directions and taking up the whole room

  After the three tentacle phases are done, the Conjunctivius can be killed.
