## Conjunctivius

![Conjunctivius](img/bosses/conjunctivius.jpg){: .side-image}

The Conjunctivius is a massive mutant creature that emerged from the sewers.
She has been contained and chained to the walls of her chamber in the hopes
it will keep her from wreaking havoc

- Cursed Sword
- Conjunctivius' Tentacle

/// info | Boss fight description
In the first phase Conjunctivius has two attacks:

- A body slam where she will extend her spikes and charge at a player
- A lacerating aura activated when a player gets too close to her

Upon reaching a certain health threshold she will scream, summoning a few
[Sewers' Tentacles](./enemies.md#sewers-tentacle). She will remain invincible
until all the tentacles have been killed. After the first tentacle phase the
Conjunctivius gains a new attack:

- A barrage of bolts targeted at a player

The Conjunctivius will enter the tentacle phase two more times, and after the
last one she will gain the last attack, which is quite rare:

- A massive barage of bolts, flying in random directions and taking up the whole room

After the three tentacle phases are done, the Conjunctivius can be killed.
