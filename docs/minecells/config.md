# Mine Cells Configuration

Many Mine Cells features can be configured to your liking.

The client-side config is only available on clients, and can be tweaked in the `minecells-client.json5` file in the config folder.  
The server-side config is available on both clients and servers, and can be tweaked in the `minecells-common.json5` file.
If you're running a server, the necessary options will be synced to the clients when they connect.

Both of these configs contain explanations for each options that should help you understand what they do.
